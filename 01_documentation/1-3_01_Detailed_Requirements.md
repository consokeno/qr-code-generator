## 1. Functional Requirements

The student must implement the project described below:

Create a web tool that generates QR codes for links, Wi-Fi access, contacts, and simple event check-in labels.

The application must include clear navigation, structured pages, input forms, validation messages, data listing pages, create/edit/delete flows where relevant, and a simple administration or management area.

## 2. User Roles

Minimum required roles:

- Administrator: can manage all records and system settings.
- Standard user: can view and manage only the records assigned to the normal workflow.
- Guest or public user: can view only public information if the project requires public pages.

- Basic audit field such as created_at and updated_at.

## 4. Non-functional Requirements

The application must be easy to run locally. The user interface must be readable on laptop and mobile screen sizes. The code must be organised into logical folders. Secrets must not be committed to GitHub. The database must be initialised from scripts. Docker Compose must start the required services.

## 5. Technical Requirements

Use Git for version control. Use GitHub for the final repository. Use Docker Compose for local execution. Use PostgreSQL or MariaDB unless the teacher approves a different database. Use environment variables for database connection settings. Include README instructions that a different student can follow without asking additional questions.
